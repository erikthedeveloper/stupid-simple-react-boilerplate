# Stupid Simple React Boilerplate

TODO: Some more relavent README details here

- Enable/Use ES6+ features right out of the box
- Enable/Use live reloading right out of the box
- Enable/Use React and JSX right out of the box
- Enable/Use WebPack to bundle all the things out of the box
- ... 

### How to develop/run

```
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Fire it up!
npm start
# Build. Be Happy.
```

- Starts a "build/watch" process via WebPack
- Starts a "live reload" server via BrowserSync
- All sorts of goodness thanks to Babel
- And probably some other great things...

Read `package.json` for more enlightening details on the simplicity of `npm` commands.
